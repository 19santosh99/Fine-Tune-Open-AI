# OpenAI Frontier Model Fine-Tuning for Amazon Product Price Prediction

This repository contains code and resources for fine-tuning the OpenAI Frontier Model using the McAuley-Lab/Amazon-Reviews-2023 dataset. The goal is to predict product prices based on item descriptions.

## Project Overview

We aim to leverage the power of OpenAI's Frontier Model and the extensive Amazon product review dataset to create a model capable of estimating product prices from textual descriptions. This project demonstrates the application of advanced language models in e-commerce and pricing strategies.

## Dataset

We use the McAuley-Lab/Amazon-Reviews-2023 dataset, which provides a comprehensive collection of Amazon product reviews and metadata. This dataset is crucial for training our model to understand the relationship between product descriptions and their corresponding prices.

## Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the Amazon review data, focusing on product descriptions and prices.
2. Fine-tuning: Adapt the OpenAI Frontier Model to our specific task of price prediction.
3. Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics for price estimation tasks.
4. Iteration: Refine the model based on performance analysis and feedback.
